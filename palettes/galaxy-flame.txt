;Palette Name: Galaxy Flame
;Description: Made this for the "Let the Galaxy Burn" event (though I did not finish my wip in time). Warm tones for distant galactic gas clouds, flames and stars, and the cool tones for skies, spaceships, and other science-fictional constructs. Semi-saturated darks in red, blue, and green to keep some life in the deep places.
